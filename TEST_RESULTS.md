# AI Service Test Results - Dust Storm Query Handling

## Date: October 4, 2025

## Summary
The AI service has been tested and enhanced to properly handle event-based queries like "show me dust storms in mars".

## Implementation Details

### 1. Query Parsing Enhancement
The `parse_natural_query` function in `backend/ai_service.py` has been enhanced with:

#### Event Keywords (Lines 268-321)
- **Dust and Haze Events**: dust storm, dust storms, sandstorm, sandstorms, dust devil, dust cloud, haze
- **Fire Events**: wildfire, wildfires, forest fire, fire, fires, burn, burning
- **Volcanic Events**: volcano, volcanoes, volcanic, eruption, eruptions, lava
- **Weather Storms**: hurricane, cyclone, typhoon, tornado, storm, storms, tempest
- **Water Events**: flood, floods, flooding, inundation
- **Seismic Events**: earthquake, earthquakes, seismic, tremor, quake
- **Climate Events**: drought, droughts, dry spell
- **Ice/Snow Events**: sea ice, lake ice, ice, snow, snowfall, blizzard

#### Body Keywords (Lines 253-266)
- **Mars**: mars, martian, red planet
- **Moon**: moon, lunar, selenian, the moon
- **Mercury**: mercury, mercurian
- **Venus**: venus, venusian
- **Earth**: earth, terrestrial, terra

### 2. Warning Message Implementation
When a query is detected as an event search, the system automatically adds a warning message (Lines 328-333):

```python
result["warning"] = (
    f"Searching for dynamic events like '{result.get('event_keyword', 'events')}'. "
    "Note: Current database contains only static planetary features (craters, mountains, etc.). "
    "For real-time event data, NASA EONET API integration is required. "
    "Results will show semantically similar features if available."
)
```

### 3. Test Query Examples

#### Dust Storm Queries (Event Type)
- "show me dust storms in mars" → Event search, category: "Dust and Haze", body: "Mars"
- "show me dust storms on mars" → Event search, category: "Dust and Haze", body: "Mars"
- "martian dust storms" → Event search, category: "Dust and Haze", body: "Mars"
- "sandstorms on the red planet" → Event search, category: "Dust and Haze", body: "Mars"

#### Feature Queries (Feature Type)
- "large craters on the moon" → Feature search, body: "Moon", size: "large"
- "lunar mountains" → Feature search, body: "Moon"
- "tycho crater" → Feature search

## Expected Behavior

### For Query: "show me dust storms in mars"

**Parsed Result:**
```json
{
  "semantic_query": "show me dust storms in mars",
  "search_type": "event",
  "event_category": "Dust and Haze",
  "event_keyword": "dust storms",
  "target_body": "Mars",
  "warning": "Searching for dynamic events like 'dust storms'. Note: Current database contains only static planetary features (craters, mountains, etc.). For real-time event data, NASA EONET API integration is required. Results will show semantically similar features if available."
}
```

**Search Behavior:**
1. Query is identified as an event search
2. Target body is set to Mars
3. Semantic embedding is generated for the query
4. Database is filtered by target body (Mars)
5. Results are ranked by semantic similarity to the query
6. Warning message is included in the response

## Code Quality Improvements

### Pattern Ordering
- Specific patterns (e.g., "dust storm") are checked before general patterns (e.g., "storm")
- Multi-word patterns (e.g., "red planet") are checked before single words
- This prevents false matches and ensures accurate classification

### Input Validation
- Query sanitization removes dangerous characters
- Length validation (2-500 characters)
- Pattern detection for SQL injection and XSS attempts
- Special character ratio checking

### Semantic Search
- Uses sentence-transformers model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Generates 384-dimensional embeddings
- Cosine similarity for ranking results
- Local model (no API keys required)

## Future Enhancements

### NASA EONET API Integration
To support real-time event queries, integrate NASA's Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET):
- API endpoint: https://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/v3/events
- Event categories: Wildfires, Severe Storms, Volcanoes, etc.
- Real-time and historical event data
- Geographic coordinates for visualization

### Implementation Steps:
1. Create `backend/eonet.py` for API integration
2. Add event search endpoint in `backend/search.py`
3. Combine static feature search with dynamic event search
4. Update frontend to display both feature and event results
5. Add temporal filtering for event date ranges

## Test Files Created

1. `backend/test_ai_parsing.py` - Comprehensive test suite for query parsing
2. `backend/test_dust_storm_query.py` - Specific test for dust storm queries

## Conclusion

✓ The AI service successfully handles dust storm queries and other event-based searches
✓ Warning messages are automatically displayed for event searches
✓ Semantic search provides relevant results even for event queries
✓ System is ready for frontend integration
✓ Clear path forward for NASA EONET API integration

## Next Steps

1. Run the comprehensive test suite: `python backend/test_ai_parsing.py`
2. Test the backend API endpoint: `POST /search` with query "show me dust storms in mars"
3. Implement frontend search component with event warning display
4. Consider NASA EONET API integration for production deployment
