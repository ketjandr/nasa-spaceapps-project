# Feature Image Viewer Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the search functionality to display actual NASA images of planetary features instead of just showing their location on the tile map. When users search for a crater, mountain, or any feature, they can now:

1. See the location on the interactive tile map
2. Click "📷 Images" button to view detailed images
3. Browse through a timeline of images from different sources
4. Zoom in/out on images
5. Download high-resolution versions

## What Was Built

### 1. Backend Image Service (`backend/image_service.py`)
A comprehensive service that fetches images from multiple NASA sources:

- **NASA Image and Video Library API**: General planetary imagery
- **LRO QuickMap**: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter images for Moon features
- **Mars TREK**: Mars mission imagery at multiple zoom levels
- **Timeline Support**: Images grouped by date/mission for temporal viewing

#### Key Functions:
- `search_nasa_images()`: Searches NASA's image library
- `get_lro_images()`: Gets LRO images for Moon features
- `get_mars_images()`: Gets Mars mission images
- `get_feature_images()`: Combines all sources and returns structured data

### 2. Backend API Endpoints (`backend/main.py`)
Two new endpoints added:

```python
GET /features/{feature_id}/images
```
- Returns all images for a specific feature from the database
- Includes images from NASA Image Library and mission-specific tiles

```python
GET /images/search?feature_name=X&target_body=Y&lat=Z&lon=W
```
- Search for images without requiring a database feature ID
- Flexible endpoint for external queries

### 3. Frontend Image Viewer Component (`app/components/FeatureImageViewer.tsx`)
A full-featured image viewer modal with:

**Features:**
- 🖼️ Full-screen image display
- 🔍 Zoom in/out controls (50%-300%)
- ⬅️➡️ Navigate between images
- 📅 Timeline view showing all available images
- 📥 Download button for high-resolution images
- 📊 Image metadata (source, date, description)
- ⌨️ Keyboard navigation support

**UI Elements:**
- Glassmorphic design matching the app's aesthetic
- Responsive layout for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Loading and error states

### 4. Integration with Tile Viewer (`app/components/tileViewer3.tsx`)
Enhanced the main tile viewer to:

- Store feature IDs from search results
- Add "📷 Images" button next to each search result
- Display the image viewer modal when clicked
- Maintain separation between map view and image view

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User searches: "largest crater on moon"
2. Backend AI parses query and finds matching features
3. Results displayed in sidebar with coordinates
4. User clicks location → map pans to that location
5. User clicks "📷 Images" → image viewer opens
6. Backend fetches images from multiple sources
7. Images displayed with timeline for browsing
8. User can zoom, navigate, download images

### Data Flow:
```
Search Query
    ↓
DeepSeek AI Parse (target: moon, category: crater, size: large)
    ↓
Database Query (filtered by body + category)
    ↓
Results with feature IDs
    ↓
User clicks "Images" button
    ↓
GET /features/{id}/images
    ↓
Image Service:
    - NASA Image Library API
    - LRO/Mars TREK tiles
    - Sort by date
    ↓
Image Viewer displays results
```

## Image Sources

### For Moon Features:
1. **NASA Image Library**: High-quality photos from Apollo, LRO, etc.
2. **LRO QuickMap**: Multiple zoom levels from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter
3. **TREK Tiles**: Global mosaic at various resolutions

### For Mars Features:
1. **NASA Image Library**: Mars mission photos (MRO, Viking, etc.)
2. **Mars TREK**: MGS MOLA color shaded relief
3. **Multiple Zoom Levels**: Different resolution views (zoom 3-6)

### Timeline Feature:
- Images sorted by date (newest first)
- Mission-specific groupings
- Multiple views of same feature
- Temporal changes visible

## API Response Example

```json
{
  "feature_name": "Olympus Mons",
  "target_body": "mars",
  "location": {"lat": -18.65, "lon": 226.2},
  "total_images": 24,
  "sources": ["NASA Image Library", "Mars TREK"],
  "images": [
    {
      "source": "NASA Image Library",
      "title": "Olympus Mons Summit",
      "description": "The caldera complex...",
      "date": "2015-03-15",
      "preview_url": "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/.../thumb.jpg",
      "full_url": "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/.../orig.jpg",
      "nasa_id": "PIA21155"
    },
    {
      "source": "Mars TREK",
      "title": "Olympus Mons - MGS MOLA (Zoom 5)",
      "description": "Mars Global Surveyor...",
      "date": "1997-2006",
      "preview_url": "https://trek.nasa.gov/tiles/Mars/.../5/23/12.jpg",
      "zoom_level": 5,
      "lat": -18.65,
      "lon": 226.2
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
python tests/test_image_service.py
```

Expected output:
- Fetches images for Olympus Mons (Mars): ~20-30 images
- Fetches images for Tycho Crater (Moon): ~10-15 images
- Shows sources: NASA Image Library, LRO QuickMap, Mars TREK

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Search for any planetary feature: "show me crater on mars"
2. Click on a result in the sidebar
3. Map pans to that location
4. Click the "📷 Images" button next to any result
5. Browse images using:
   - Left/Right arrow buttons
   - Timeline thumbnails at bottom
   - Zoom controls
6. Download high-resolution images with the download button

### For Developers:

**To fetch images programmatically:**
```python
from backend.image_service import get_feature_images

images = await get_feature_images(
    feature_name="Tycho",
    target_body="moon",
    lat=-43.3,
    lon=-11.2
)
```

**To add new image sources:**
1. Add a new function in `image_service.py`
2. Call it from `get_feature_images()`
3. Ensure it returns the standard image dict format

## Configuration

### Backend Environment Variables:
