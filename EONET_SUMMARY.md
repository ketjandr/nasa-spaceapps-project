# NASA EONET Integration - Complete Summary

## Date: October 4, 2025

## ✅ Implementation Complete

NASA EONET (Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker) has been successfully integrated into the Stellar Canvas project. The system can now handle queries like "show me dust storms in mars" with real-time event data from NASA.

## 🎯 Query: "show me dust storms in mars"

### How It Works Now:

1. **Query Parsing**
   ```json
   {
     "search_type": "event",
     "event_category": "Dust and Haze",
     "event_keyword": "dust storms",
     "target_body": "Mars",
     "warning": "Searching for dynamic events like 'dust storms'..."
   }
   ```

2. **Dual Search Execution**
   - **EONET Search**: Fetches Earth dust/haze events from last 30 days
   - **Database Search**: Queries Mars features from database
   - Results merged and ranked by relevance

3. **Response Structure**
   ```json
   {
     "results": [
       {
         "id": "EONET_12345",
         "name": "Saharan Dust Storm",
         "is_dynamic_event": true,
         "event_date": "2025-10-03",
         "latitude": 23.5,
         "longitude": 12.3,
         ...
       },
       {
         "id": 42,
         "name": "Martian Crater XYZ",
         "is_dynamic_event": false,
         "body": "Mars",
         ...
       }
     ],
     "event_count": 1,
     "feature_count": 1
   }
   ```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### 1. Unified Search (Recommended)
```bash
POST /search/query
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "show me dust storms",
  "limit": 10,
  "include_events": true,
  "event_days": 30
}
```

### 2. Direct Event Access
```bash
# Get events by category
GET /search/events?category=Dust%20and%20Haze&limit=10&days=30

# Get all recent events
GET /search/events?limit=10&days=7

# Get specific event
GET /search/events/EONET_12345
```

## 🎨 Frontend Integration Guide

### Distinguishing Events from Features

```typescript
// Check if result is a live event
if (result.is_dynamic_event) {
  // Display with:
  // - Orange/red marker (not blue)
  // - Pulse animation
  // - "LIVE" badge
  // - Event date
  // - Link to NASA source
} else {
  // Display as static feature
  // - Blue/gray marker
  // - No animation
  // - Feature category
}
```

### Visual Design Recommendations

**Events:**
- Color: Orange (#FF6B35) or Red (#E74C3C)
- Icon: Flame, storm, or relevant symbol
- Animation: Subtle pulse or glow
- Badge: "LIVE EVENT" or date badge
- Hover: Show event source links

**Features:**
- Color: Blue (#3498DB) or Gray (#95A5A6)
- Icon: Pin marker or category icon
- Animation: None (static)
- Label: Feature name + category
- Hover: Show description + origin

### Example Component

```jsx
<SearchResult 
  result={result}
  onClick={() => navigateToLocation(result.latitude, result.longitude)}
>
  {result.is_dynamic_event && (
    <Badge variant="live">
      🔴 LIVE - {formatDate(result.event_date)}
    </Badge>
  )}
  <Title>{result.name}</Title>
  <Category>{result.category}</Category>
  {result.is_dynamic_event && result.event_sources && (
    <SourceLinks sources={result.event_sources} />
  )}
</SearchResult>
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Earth Events Only
- EONET only tracks **Earth events** (wildfires, storms, etc.)
- Mars/Moon queries will **not** return Mars dust storms
- System handles this by:
  1. Searching EONET for Earth events
  2. Searching database for Mars/Moon features
  3. Combining results with clear indicators

### Rate Limiting
- EONET API is free and open (no API key required)
- Consider implementing caching for frequent queries
- Default timeout: 30 seconds
- Graceful fallback if EONET unavailable

### Data Freshness
- Events update in near real-time (minutes to hours)
- Use `days` parameter to control lookback period
- Events can be "open" (active) or "closed" (resolved)
- Default lookback: 30 days

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready Now)
1. ✅ Test backend with: `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000`
2. ✅ Test search: `POST /search/query` with "dust storms"
3. ✅ Test events: `GET /search/events?category=Wildfires`
4. ✅ View API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Frontend Integration (Next Phase)
1. Create search UI component
2. Add event result rendering with live badges
3. Implement globe markers for events vs features
4. Add event source links
5. Create event timeline view (optional)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Caching** - Redis cache for EONET responses (5-10 min TTL)
2. **WebSocket** - Real-time event updates pushed to clients
3. **Notifications** - Subscribe to event categories
4. **Historical Analysis** - Trend charts and heatmaps
5. **Mars Weather** - Integrate Mars weather API when available

## 🎉 Conclusion

The NASA EONET integration is **complete and operational**. The system now provides a comprehensive search experience that seamlessly combines:

- **Static planetary features** (Moon, Mars, Mercury craters, mountains, etc.)
- **Dynamic Earth events** (Wildfires, storms, volcanoes in real-time)

When users search for "dust storms", they'll receive:
- Real-time dust/haze events from EONET (Earth)
- Semantically similar Mars features from the database
- Clear indicators showing which are live events vs. static features

The implementation is production-ready and waiting for frontend integration! 🚀
